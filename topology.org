* Topological Spaces
Given a set $X$ of elements, a *topology* $\mathcal{T}$ is a collection of
subsets of $X$ ($\mathcal{T} \subseteq 2^{X}$) such that:

1. $X, \emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$
2. $\mathcal{T}$ is stable under arbitrary unions
3. $\mathcal{T}$ is stable under finite intersection

An element $O \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ is called an *open set* and 
an ordered pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is called a *topological space*.

** T1 Spaces
A topological space $(X, \mathcal T)$ is a *T1 Space* if for any distinct points
$x, y \in X$, there exist open neighborhoods $O_x, O_y$ of $x$ and $y$,
respectively, such that $x \notin O_y$ and $y \notin O_x$.

Note that in a T1 space, the limits of convergent sequence need not be unique.

** T2 Spaces
A topological space $(X, \mathcal T)$ is a *T2* (or *Hausdorff*)
*Space* if for any distinct points $x, y \in X$, there exist open
neighborhoods $O_x, O_y$ of $x$ and $y$, respectively, such that
$O_x \cap O_y = \emptyset$.

Note that in a Hausdorff space, the limits of convergent sequences are unique.

* Convergent Sequences
Given a topological space $(X, \mathcal T)$, a sequence $x_n \in X$
converges to a **limit** $l \in X$ if for any open neighborhood $O_l \in
\mathcal T$ of $l$, there exists an $N$ such for for $n \geq N$,
$x_n \in O_l$.

* Continuous Functions
A function $f:(X, \mathcal A) \rightarrow (Y, \mathcal B)$ between two
topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ is *continuous* at a point $x_0 \in X$ if for
any open neighborhood $O_Y$ of $f(x_0)$, an open neighborhood $O_X$ of $x_0$ is
contained in the preimage of $O_Y$ - i.e. $O_X \subseteq f^{-1}(O_Y)$. $f$ is a
*continuous function* if it is continuous at all points in $X$.  A consequence
of the above definition is that $f$ is continuous if and only if for any open
set $O \in \mathcal B$, its preimage is an open set (i.e. $f^{-1}(O) \in
\mathcal A$).

** Homeomorphism
A homeomorphism is a bijective, continuous function $f$ with a continuous
inverse $f^{-1}$.

** Uniform Continuity
A function $f$ between two metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$
is *uniformly continuous* if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a
$\delta > 0$ such that $d_X(x, y) < \delta$ implies $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) <
\epsilon$ for all $x, y \in X$. Note that this is a stronger form of
continuity because the choice of $\delta$ must hold for all $x, y \in
X$.

An example of a function which is continuous but not uniformly continuous is $f
(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ on the interval $ (0, 1) $. For any fixed $\epsilon$, the
$\delta$ required converges to 0 as one moves towards 0.

** Absolute Continuity
A function $f$ between two metric spaces $(X \subseteq \mathbb{R}, d_X)$
and $(Y, d_Y)$ is *absolutely continuous* on an interval $I \subseteq
\mathbb{R}$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $ \delta > 0 $
such that for any finite set of pairwise disjoint subintervals $(x_k, y_k)
\subset I $ such that $ \sum_k d_X(x_k, y_k) \leq \delta$, then $ \sum_k
d_Y(f(x_k), f(y_k)) \leq \epsilon$.

For measures, a measure $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a
measure $\lambda$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta >
0$ such that $\mu(A) \leq \delta$ implies $\lambda(A) \leq \epsilon
$. This implies that $\\lambda(A) = 0$ implies $\mu(A) = 0$.

** Holder Continuity
A function $f$ between two metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$
is *Holder continuous* if there exists real numbers $ L \geq 0 $ and $
\alpha > 0$ such that $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) \leq L d_X(x, y)^{\alpha}$ for all
$x, y \in X$.

** Lipschitz Continuity
A function $f$ between two metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$
is *Lipschitz continuous* if there exists a real number $ L \geq 0 $ such
that $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) \leq L d_X(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$.

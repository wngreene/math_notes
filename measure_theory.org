* Algebra of Sets
Given a set of $X$ of elements, an *algebra* $\Sigma$ is a non-empty
collection of subsets of $X$ such that:
1. \(A \in \Sigma \rightarrow A^c \in \Sigma\)
2. $A, B \in \Sigma \rightarrow A \cup B \in \Sigma$

Note that this means that $\Sigma$ is an algebra if it is stable under a
*finite* number of set operations.

** $\sigma$-algebra
Given a set $X$ of elements, a *$\sigma$-algebra* $\Sigma$ is a
collection of subsets of $X$ ($\Sigma \subseteq 2^X$) such that:

1. $\Sigma$ is non-empty
2. $\Sigma$ is stable under complementation
3. $\Sigma$ is stable under *countable* unions
An element $E \in \Sigma$ is called a *measurable set*.

Note that as consequences of the above definition, both $X$ and
$\emptyset$ are in $\Sigma$. In addition, $\Sigma$ is stable under
countable intersections.

** Borel $\sigma$-algebra
Given a topological space $(X, \mathcal T)$, a *Borel set* is any set that
can be constructed from the open sets by countable unions, countable
intersections, and complementation. The set of all such sets is called a *Borel
$\sigma$-algebra*. It is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains
all of the open sets of $(X, \mathcal T)$.

* Measrurable Function
A function $f: (X, \mathcal A) \rightarrow (Y, \mathcal B)$ between
measurable spaces $X$ and $Y$ is a *measurable function* if and only
if for any measurable set $E \in \mathcal B$, its preimage $f^{-1}(E)$
is a measurable set (i.e. $f^{-1}(E) \in \mathcal A$).

* Measurable Space
An ordered pair $(X, \Sigma)$, where $X$ is a set of elements an $\Sigma$ is
a $\sigma$-algebra over those elements, is called a *measurable space*.

* Measure 
Given a measurable space $(X, \Sigma)$, a function $\mu: \Sigma \rightarrow
\mathbb R$ is a *measure* if:

1. $\mu(E) \geq 0$ for all $E \in \Sigma$
2. $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
3. $\mu(\cup_i E_i) = \Sigma_i \mu(E_i)$ for any collection of pairwise disjoint measurable sets $E_i \in \Sigma$.

An ordered tuple $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ is called a *measure space*.

** Lebesgue Measure
The *Lebesgue Measure* is a standard measure for Euclidean space.

** Counting Measure
The *Counting Measure* is defined as $\mu(E) = |E|$.

* Lebesgue Integral
Given a measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ and a function $f: X \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}^+$, the *Lebesgue* integral is defined as $\int f d\mu =
\int_0^{\infty} f^*(t) dt$, where $f^*(t) = \mu(\{x:f(x) > t\})$
